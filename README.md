# Lumina Parse UI

Interactive React front end used to explore and validate document extraction results generated by Lumina Parse.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a recent LTS release of Node.js and npm installed.

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd lumina-parse-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default (configured in `vite.config.ts`).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite development server with hot module reload.
- `npm run build` – produce an optimized production build in `dist`.
- `npm run build:dev` – build with Vite using the development mode profile.
- `npm run preview` – serve the contents of `dist` locally to validate a production build.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint across the project.

## Tech Stack

- Vite + TypeScript
- React 18
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- TanStack Query for async data flows

## Project Structure

The main application code lives under `src/`:

- `components/` – UI building blocks, composed into feature panels.
- `hooks/` – shared React hooks.
- `lib/` – utility functions.
- `pages/` – top-level route components served via React Router.
- `types/` – shared TypeScript definitions.

## Deployment

Build artifacts are generated in `dist/`. Deploy the contents of that directory to your preferred hosting provider (e.g. Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, Vercel, or an S3 bucket behind a CDN).
